       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>The Indian Super League (ISL) is a professional football league, which represents the sport's highest level
             in Indian football system. it is organized by the All India Football Federation and their commercial
              partners Football Sports Development. Due to sponsorship reason with Hero MotoCorp, it is officially 
              called Hero Indian Super League. The league currently comprises of 11 clubs. Each season of the tournament
               generally runs from November to March. During the league stage of the competition, each club plays against
                all the other clubs in a round-robin style. At the end of the league stage the team with the most points
                 gets declared the Premiers and presented with a trophy named League Winners' Shield, and the top four 
                 clubs qualifies for the play-offs. The season then culminates with the ISL Final to determine the Champions 
                 who are presented with the ISL Trophy.</p>

           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> The competition was founded on 21 October 2013 with the goal of growing the sport of football in India 
               and increasing its exposure in the country. The league began in October 2014 with eight teams. During its
                first three seasons, the competition operated without official recognition from the Asian Football
                 Confederation (AFC), the governing body for the sport in Asia. The competition was also structured along 
                 the same lines as the Indian Premier League, the country's premier Twenty20 franchise based cricket competition
                 . Each season lasted just 3 months, from October to December, and matches were held daily.</p>
